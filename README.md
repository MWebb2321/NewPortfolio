# NewPortfolio

In this updated portfolio of mine, I've included various projects that I've worked on since the beginning of class up until the most recent. From pictures to a short description of the project. Also, I added links to the respective repository below the pictures. I've included a calendar app, weather app, a quiz, and the first group project.

## Description

After updating my portfolio with new projects, we were tasked with utilizing React, as well.
