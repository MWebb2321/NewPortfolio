            Born in 1987, I was the youngest of three children. My parents
            always taught me the value of hard work, determination, and
            perseverance. Growing up, I never had a set career path in mind, but
            I knew that no matter what I put my efforts into, that I would go
            far. I graduated from Denair High in 2005 and attended Modesto
            Junior College, where I encountered a menagerie of different walks
            of life. My world would never be the same. It wasn't until a close
            friend of mine suggested that I attend a climbing school in Idaho.
            Northwest Lineman College helped shape my mind and body even
            further. The rigors that I endured were worth the turmoil and now,
            I'm expanding my mind-muscles. In the winter of 2020, I began my
            coding odyssey. The instructor, TA's, and other students have been
            greatly appreciated and have helped along the way.

            I've been a part of great teams and look forward to meeting and
            working with excellent mentors. Honesty and integrity are values
            that I do my best to embody, for my own standards and for others...
            A positive work environment that encourages and develops their
            employees is ideal. While I know how to work diligently, I make sure
            to take time for myself. Over the years, I've discovered that most
            physical activities are a must for me. Country swing dance, hiking,
            and working out have been great outlets for me to meet new people
            and burn off some energy. Though I always enjoying being physically
            active and enjoying life, I know when to buckle down and get work
            done.

            Over the years, I've learned to forge my own path and always have a
            good time. While I know when to be serious and get things done, I
            make sure that I maintain my child at heart attitude.
