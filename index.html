                    Born in 1987, I was the youngest of three children. 
                    My parents always taught me the value of hard work, determination, and perseverance. 
                    Growing up, I never had a set career path in mind, but I knew that no matter what I put my efforts into, that I would go far. 
                    I graduated from Denair High in 2005 and attended Modesto Junior College, where I encountered a menagerie of different walks of life. 
                    My world would never be the same. 
                    It wasn't until a close friend of mine suggested that I attend a climbing school in Idaho. 
                    Northwest Lineman College helped shape my mind and body even further. 
                    The rigors that I endured were worth the turmoil and now, I'm expanding my mind-muscles. 
                    In the winter of 2020, I began my coding odyssey. 
                    The instructor, TA's, and other students have been greatly appreciated and have helped along the way.

                    I've been a part of great teams and look forward to meeting and working with excellent mentors.
                    Honesty and integrity are values that I do my best to embody, for my own standards and for others...
                    A positive work environment that encourages and develops their employees is ideal.
                    While I know how to work diligently, I make sure to take time for myself.
                    Over the years, I've discovered that most physical activities are a must for me.
                    Country swing dance, hiking, and working out have been great outlets for me to meet new people and burn off some energy.
                    Though I always enjoying being physically active and enjoying life, I know when to buckle down and get work done.

                  Over the years, I've learned to forge my own path and always have a good time.
                  While I know when to be serious and get things done, I make sure that I maintain my child at heart attitude.
